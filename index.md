*Murda on the beat so it's not nice*

**3 PM**
* She wanna keep goin' when it's 3 PM
* Ride with the homies when it's 3 PM
## Like what you doing 'round 4?
> Would you go in other cities, goin' with me on a tour?
Steppin' with me on the mat and goin' with me, open door
***

1. Like, "Good afternoon", oh, good evening
2. I heard about your ex, about you leavin' him
3. I heard about the fights, about you leavin'

```
He don't love you anyway
He don't love you, he don't love you anyway
```
